The page can be used by following the URL above or downloading the repository

the top right corner of the window and type the name of any city -- for example
"London" or "Paris". Following this, click on the search button to be taken to a
display of information about that city. Subsequent searches can then be made
using the search bar at the top of the page in the same manner, the saved
searches button in the bottom right corner of the page or using the "new search"
or "saved destinations" buttons at the bottom of the main content block. If
starting a new search, simply type the search location. If repeating a search
